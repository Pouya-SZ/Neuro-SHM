Vibration Analysis of a Wind Turbine Gearbox for Off-cloud Health Monitoring through Neuromorphic-computing Approaches

The open access Gearbox Fault Diagnosis dataset, available at the OpenEI repository (https://openei.org/datasets/dataset/gearbox-fault-diagnosisdata), was used in this study for training and evaluating the neuromorphic-compatible model for fault detection
